# text-editor-pwa

For this assignment, I modified the pre-existing code to create a task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and adjusts the date to MM/DD/YYYY using dayjs.

The following image shows the web application and local storage of the tasks:
